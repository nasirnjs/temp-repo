**Answer**


For a comprehensive example of setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins in a GitOps environment, please refer to my Git repositories. I maintain two separate repositories that demonstrate a clear separation of concerns:

Kubernetes Manifests: [GitOps-K8s-Repo](https://github.com/nasirnjs/ci-cd-k8s)

Application Code: [GitOps-App-Repo](https://github.com/nasirnjs/ci-cd-app)
